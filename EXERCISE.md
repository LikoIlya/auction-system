Design and build a simple auction website, like Ebay, where people can see a list of items and the ability to bid on them. The auction must have an end date and time, after which the item is sold to the highest bidder. The goal of this exercise is to demonstrate that you can take an idea with very little requirements and turn that into a working prototype. The missing requirements will need creativity and common sense to solve.

Getting started:

- Pick a language from .Net Core or NodeJs for the backend
- Choose a front-end frame work that you like working with
- Think about maintainability of the solution by other developers
- We would like to see some automated tests on this solution
- The challenge is about the auction functionality. Therefore items, users, etc can be hard coded.
